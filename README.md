# Support Vector Machines and Artificial Neural Network Projects

Repository of Support Vector Machines and Artificial Neural Network Projects using different datasets such as occupation and cell subscriber churn data.

In this project, we utilized two machine learning techniques involving a dataset of subscribers of a
cellular network where we will determine if the particular customer churns or not. First, a Support Vector
Machine (SVM) was implemented and was found that the all kernels have similar accuracy but we will
choose a radial one, as it has a slightly higher specificity. For SVM, we were able to accurately predict 74%
of the customers that churned. Second, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was also utilized. Ultimately,
it gave us a similar accuracy of 74%, even with varying values.
